      <section>
        <p>I have been accepted to DevPoint Labs' Ruby on Rails web development bootcamp for the Spring 2017 cohort.
          I was awarded the Hopper Scholarship, which is so exciting, but there is a lot pressure that comes with such a
          gift. I am terrified and excited to take on this new adventure!</p>

        <p>So, where <em>am</em> I going? I really don't know, but I <i>do</i> know it's going to be great.</p>

        <p>My goal is to complement my existing skill set to move up in the world and gain
          complete independence. I am so much stronger than I ever imagined I could be and now I am
          ready to create a life for myself and my kids that mirrors this.</p>

        <p>My coding background is pretty shoddy and to call it out-of-date is a significant
          understatement.  However, when I learned Pascal in 8th grade, I was the top of my class
          and the same the semester I took Lisp in college.  I think I have a coder's brain.
          We're about to find out!</p>

        <p>I really feel like this is finally going to be my year and it all starts with Ruby on Rails
          under the tutelage of DPL.</p>
