      <p>First and foremost I am the obsessive mother of two dogs,
        Guy and Cooper. You can learn all about them <a class="link-style" href="gandc.html">
        here</a>.</p>

        <p>I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Ron and Sally Larkin.
        I have two older biological brothers, a younger brother who is handicapped,
        and four Tongan brothers. I am the only girl and I love that.</p>

        <p>I graduated from the Waterford School in 1997 and headed to upstate NY
        where I attended Vassar College and had more fun than I can publish online.
        I graduated in Studio Art, which was amazing and did not prepare me for a
        career. Or maybe I didn't capitalize on my skill set quickly enough. Either
        way, it has led me to expand my capabilities with the complement of web development
        at <a class="link-style" href="dpl.html">DevPoint Labs</a>. You can read more about this
        on my <a class="link-style" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsaylarkin">LinkedIn</a> profile.</p>

        <p>I am addicted to music. '80s New Wave and Synthpop are easily my favourite
        genres and The Smiths are my favourite band. I also <em>love</em> Phil Collins,
        Taylor Swift, and One Direction. 1D have been my current fave for several years
        now and I'm probably the oldest person in their fanbase.</p>

        <p>I live for the ballet and danced for 18 years with a hiatus during high school.
        I am a rapacious reader with a penchant for Dostoevsky and Sholokhov as well as the Sherlock Holmes
        anthology. I love crime dramas and horror movies. Finally, I love to run, or moving mediatation
        as I genreally refer to it. I live with an overactive brain and while I can't shut in off
        whilst running, I can't hold on to a thought long enough to ruminate.</p>

        <p>Everything is better with champagne!</p>
